# Tutorial for Minetest

Created by Wuzzy

Version: 3.0.1
Playable in Minetest 5.0.0 or later.

Learn how to use and play Minetest in a nice and cozy castle. Here you learn most of the basics of Minetest and how to play.

## How to install
First, you have to install Minetest.

You can download the Tutorial from the Content DB in Minetest ("Content" tab).
Minetest will then dothe rest for you.

### Manual installation
If for some reason the Content DB doesnt work, you can still fall back to manual installation.
If you have manually downloaded the Tutorial (e.g. from the Minetest forums), here's how to install it:

Then, put this "tutorial" directory into the "games" sub-directory of your Minetest user directory.

Depending on your operating system, you have to put it into the following directory:

* GNU/Linux: $HOME/.minetest/games, where “$HOME” refers to your home directory.
* MacOS: $HOME/.minetest/games, where “$HOME” refers to your home directory.
* Windows: into the "games" sub-directory of the program folder in which you have installed Minetest. It is the directory containing the directories (not necessarily exhaustive list) bin (which in turn contains minetest.exe), builtin, client, doc, fonts, games, locale, mods and textures. 


## How to use
Start Minetest, select “Start Game” (i.e. singleplayer) then select the “Tutorial” icon below.

Create a new world and hit “Play Game”. The Tutorial should explain the rest.

## Resetting the tutorial
In case you want to start over, you can just create a new world and play with that one instead.

## Features
The tutorial covers the following topics:

* Minetest, mods and games
* Camera
* Movement
* Sneaking
* Pointing
* Sneaking
* Mining
* Building
* Liquids
* Items, tools
* Crafting

* Death and respawning
* A few random hints

This tutorial is written in a fairly generic way and does not focus on any particular game for Minetest. Real games for Minetest will likely have additional or slightly different rules, but the basics will generally be the same.

If you have completed all tasks, you will be awarded a golden cup.
There's also a secret prize, can you win it?
